> [4Geeks Academy](https://4geeksacademy.com/) -
> ML and AI Bootcamp 

This project was developed in six parts or phases, each of them will be explained in the further sections.

## First: The Problem Definition :thinking:

We want to answer the question of *if a match between two teams in the first phase of the FIFA World Cup 2022 is chosen Â¿which team would win?*

## Second: The Data collection :globe_with_meridians:

For this project we will use the dataset provided by the user **martj42** in the plataform Kaggle. The dataset is named **results.csv**[^1] and you can find it [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/martj42/international-football-results-from-1872-to-2017?select=shootouts.csv).

[^1]: The information about the features in the dataset is available in the EDA. 

## Third : Exploratory Data Analysis :mag:
The EDA could be found [here](src/final_project.ipynb).

## Fourth: 4. Data Preprocessing :memo:

The data processing could be found [here](src/final_project.ipynb) and in a rawest version [here](src/model.py).

## Fifth: 5. Model and results :briefcase:

The model and results could be found [here](src/final_project.ipynb) and in a rawest version [here](src/model.py).

## Sixth: 6. Deployment :rocket:

The streamlit application code is [here](app.py) and its deploytmen could be found [here](https://wc-predictor.herokuapp.com).
